On December 14, 2009, Allen was named interim head coach of the Penn men\\'s basketball team after the firing of [[Glen Miller (basketball)|Glen Miller]].  On March 31, 2010, he was announced as the new permanent head coach of the Penn Men\\'s Basketball team. He resigned his position as head coach effective on March 10, 2015.Jerome Allen (basketball)\\n\\n==Coaching career==\\n\\n===Boston Celtics===\\n\\nAllen joined the Boston Celtics in 2015 under head coach [[Brad Stevens]]. Allen was one of Boston\\'s longer-tenured assistants and was with the team for all but two seasons of the Brad Stevens era.Jerome Allen (basketball)\\n\\n==Coaching career==\\n\\n===Detroit Pistons===\\n\\nIn summer 2021, Allen announced he was leaving the Celtics\\' coaching staff to join [[Dwane Casey]] in Detroit.Jerome Allen (basketball)\\n\\n==Bribery case and related NCAA sanctions==\\n\\nIn October 2018, Allen pleaded guilty to accepting an $18,000 bribe in 2014 while the head coach at Penn to help a student get on the recruiting list in order to get accepted to the university. He was ordered to pay back $18,000 in addition to a $200,000 fine. He would testify on behalf of the federal government against the man he said had bribed him – Phillip Esformes. During Esformes\\'s trial, Allen testified that he had received about $300,000 in bribes from Esformes, and that the student in question was Esformes\\'s son.\\n\\nOn February 26, 2020, the NCAA announced penalties against Allen and the Penn men\\'s basketball program stemming from the bribes. The program was placed on two years\\' probation but did not receive a postseason ban. Allen received a 15-year [[show-cause penalty]] from the NCAA, effective until February 20, 2035. It is the longest ever handed down to a (former) head coach. During this period, any school that hires Allen must \"show cause\" for why it should not be sanctioned for doing so. In an unusual move, if Allen gets a head coaching job after the show-cause expires, he must sit out the first half of the first season of his return. It is very difficult for a head coach to return to the collegiate ranks even after a show-cause expires, since many presidents and athletic directors are extremely reluctant to hire someone with a show-cause on his record. Only four coaches have ever worked in college basketball again after receiving a show-cause.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023|reason=specific enough that this seems like it was found somewhere, would like to have source to back it up}}Jerome Allen (basketball)\\n\\n==Head coaching record==\\n\\n{{CBB Yearly Record Start\\n|type=coach\\n|conference=\\n|postseason=}}\\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead\\n|name=[[Penn Quakers men\\'s basketball|Penn Quakers]]\\n|startyear=2009\\n|conference=[[Ivy League]]\\n|endyear=2015\\n}}\\n{{CBB Yearly Record Entry\\n | championship =\\n | season       = [[2009–10 NCAA Division I men\\'s basketball season|2009–10]]\\n | name         = Penn\\n | overall      = 6–15\\n | conference   = 5–9\\n | confstanding = T–5th\\n | postseason   =\\n | ranking      = no\\n | ranking2     = no\\n}}\\n{{CBB Yearly Record Entry\\n | championship =\\n | season       = [[2010–11 NCAA Division I men\\'s basketball season|2010–11]]\\n | name         = Penn\\n | overall      = 13–15\\n | conference   = 7–7\\n | confstanding = 4th\\n | postseason   =\\n | ranking      = no\\n | ranking2     = no\\n}}\\n{{CBB Yearly Record Entry\\n | championship =\\n | season       = [[2011–12 NCAA Division I men\\'s basketball season|2011–12]]\\n | name         = [[2011–12 Penn Quakers men\\'s basketball team|Penn]]\\n | overall      = 20–13\\n | conference   = 11–3\\n | confstanding = 2nd\\n | postseason   = [[2012 College Basketball Invitational|CBI Quarterfinals]]\\n | ranking      = no\\n | ranking2     = no\\n}}\\n{{CBB Yearly Record Entry\\n | championship =\\n | season       = [[2012–13 NCAA Division I men\\'s basketball season|2012–13]]\\n | name         = [[2012–13 Penn Quakers men\\'s basketball team|Penn]]\\n | overall      = 9–22\\n | conference   = 6–8\\n | confstanding = 5th\\n | postseason   = \\n | ranking      = no\\n | ranking2     = no\\n}}\\n{{CBB Yearly Record Entry\\n | championship =\\n | season       = [[2013–14 NCAA Division I men\\'s basketball season|2013–14]]\\n | name         = [[2014–15 Penn Quakers men\\'s basketball team|Penn]]\\n | overall      = 8–20\\n | conference   = 5–9\\n | confstanding = 6th\\n | postseason   = \\n | ranking      = no\\n | ranking2     = no\\n}}\\n{{CBB Yearly Record Entry\\n | championship =\\n | season       = [[2014–15 NCAA Division I men\\'s basketball season|2014–15]]\\n | name         = [[2014–15 Penn Quakers men\\'s basketball team|Penn]]\\n | overall      = 9–19\\n | conference   = 4–10\\n | confstanding = 8th\\n | postseason   = \\n | ranking      = no\\n | ranking2     = no\\n}}\\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subtotal\\n | name       = Penn\\n | overall    = {{winpct|65|104|record=y}}\\n | confrecord = {{winpct|38|46|record=y}}\\n}}\\n{{CBB Yearly Record End\\n|overall={{winpct|65|104|record=y}}\\n|poll=no}}', \"Summarize this persons life description in 1 textual sentence with line breaks every 10 words focusing on their occupation and work primarily, also say when they graduated from or attended EA Alan W.

He then enrolled in the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where he studied architecture. While there, he was a member of the fraternity of Delta Psi (aka St. Anthony Hall).Henry G. Morse\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nHe established himself in [[Manhattan, New York City]] before the age of 20. As an associate, he collaborated with Boston architect [[Herbert D. Hale]] on the [[Camden Free Public Library Main Building]] (1903–05) in [[Camden, New Jersey]]; the Norfolk Public Library (1903–06) in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]; and the [[Engineering Societies\\' Building|United Engineering Societies]] Building (1904–07) in New York City.
